# Advent of Code 2021 - Rust

Some of the exercises of [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solved using [Rust Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I wanted to learn and practice a new programming language. I chose Rust because it is very different to the languages I usually use. The code is far from perfect, but it may be useful for someone.
